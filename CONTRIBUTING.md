# Contributing to Clojure

Following the lead of other open source projects, the Clojure project
requires contributors to jointly assign their copyright on contributed
code. The [Contributor Agreement](http://clojure.org/space/showimage/ca.pdf)
(CA) gives Rich Hickey and the contributor joint copyright interests
in the code: the contributor retains copyrights while also granting
those rights to Rich Hickey as the open source project sponsor.

The CA is derived from the Oracle Contributor Agreement (OCA), used
for Open JDK, Netbeans and OpenSolaris projects and others. There is a
good [OCA FAQ](http://oss.oracle.com/oca-faq.pdf) answering many questions.

The CA does not change the rights or responsibilities of the Clojure
community under the [Eclipse Public License (EPL)](http://opensource.org/licenses/eclipse-1.0.php).
By executing the CA, contributors protect the Clojure code base,
enable alternative licensing models, and protect the flexibility to
adapt the project to the changing demands of the community. In order
for the CA to be effective, the Clojure project must obtain an
assignment for all contributions. Please review the CA for a complete
understanding of its terms and conditions. By contributing source code
or other material to Clojure, you represent that you have a CA with
Rich Hickey for such contributions. In order to track contributors,
you understand that your full name and username may be posted on a web
page listing authorized contributors that is accessible via a public
URL.

## Making a contribution

Before you invest time working on a change, discuss what you're trying
to do with others on the [Clojure Dev Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/clojure-dev).
They're likely to be able to offer comments and suggestions that will
result in a higher-quality change and a smoother submission
process. Announcing that you're working on a particular item can also
help to avoid wasted effort in case someone else is already working on
it. Once you've submitted the CA, you can [submit patches via
JIRA](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ).
Frequent and trusted contributors of more substantial libraries may be
granted committer membership in the
[clojure-contrib](http://github.com/clojure/clojure-contrib) project.

If you'd like to submit a patch, please follow these guidelines on the
[preferred process for submitting](http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/JIRA+workflow).
